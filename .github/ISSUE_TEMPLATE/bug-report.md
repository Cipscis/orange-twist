## What happened

<!-- Describe the bug you have observed. Be as specific as you can. It helps to describe any actions you've taken, as well as what you saw. -->

## What should have happened

<!-- Describe what behaviour you expected to see instead. Again, be as specific as you can. -->

## Steps to replicate

<!-- It's very difficult to investigate or fix a bug without knowing how to replicate it. Please be as detailed as you can in describing how to replicate the bug. -->

## Web browser

<!-- Sometimes, a bug only happens on a specific browser. Please specify what web browser you observed the bug in (e.g. Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox) and what version it is. You can usually find the version through a "Help" or "About" menu. -->
