<!--
While I welcome feature requests, please keep in mind that this is a personal project that I have opened up for others to use, and I only work on it in my spare time. My first priority is going to be that Orange Twist continues to work in a way that matches how I think.

If you'd like to modify Orange Twist to work better for you, please familiar yourself with the licence specified in the package.json file and create a fork of this project.

## The problem

<!--
Describe the problem that you would like your new feature to address.

Framing your feature in terms of a problem is helpful because it can help me come up with alternative solutions that may be a better fit for Orange Twist.
