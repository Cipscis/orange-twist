[Orange Twist](https://cipscis.github.io/orange-twist/)

## Development

You will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) before working on this project.

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/cipscis/orange-twist.git`.
2. Run `npm install` to install development dependencies.
3. Create a [`.env`](#env) file.
4. Run `npm start` to run the local server and watch CSS and JS files for changes.

Usually, you will just want to run `npm start`, but this project also provides the following npm scripts:

* `npm run server` runs a Node.js server on the port specified in the [`.env`](#env) file, using [Express](https://expressjs.com/).

* `npm run build` compiles CSS files using [sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass), then typechecks TypeScript using [the TypeScript compiler](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html) and bundles TypeScript and any JavaScript using [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/).

* `npm run watch` compiles both CSS and TypeScript+JavaScript files just like `npm run build`, but in watch mode so any further changes will result in recompilation. Also runs any configured tests suites in watch mode.

* `npm run lint` lints all JavaScript and TypeScript files using [eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint) and all SCSS files using [stylelint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylelint).

* `npm start` runs both the `server` and `watch` tasks simultaneously.

* `npm test` runs any configured test suites using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
* `npm run testCoverage` runs any configured test suites using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), and reports coverage information.
* `npm run testWatch` runs any configured test suites using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) in watch mode.

### .env

The `.env` file contains the following environment variables:

* `PROJECT_NAME` `(string)`

If present, used by [Express](https://expressjs.com/) to set up redirects for emulating [GitHub Pages](#github-pages).

* `MODE` `(string 'development' | 'production')`

Used by Webpack to determine what optimisations to use and how to generate sourcemaps.

* `PORT` `(int)`

Used by [Express](https://expressjs.com/) to determine which port to use when running a local Node.js server.

An example `.env` file you can use for development is:

```
PROJECT_NAME = "orange-twist"
MODE = "development"
PORT = "8080"
```

This file is intended to differ from environment to environment, so it is ignored by Git.
